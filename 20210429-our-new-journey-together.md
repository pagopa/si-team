# Our new journey, together!

Hey folks,
We are a bunch of people on the mission to contribute to the digital transformation of Italy as a country. We’re formally the Strategic Innovation department of [PagoPA S.p.A.](https://www.pagopa.gov.it/), but we like to think of ourselves as parts of a larger and highly interconnected community.

Hence this blog will be our voice beyond our "natural" boundaries, and hopefully, our way to gather your attention on what we try to achieve.

Here’s what you will read:

- our vision of the future,
- who we are, and our stories,
- our challenges, successes, and failures,
- our milestones,
- many chapters, whose threads will intersect,
- our core values, transparency, openness, sharing, giving-back,
- our amazing tools, and best practices.

So here we’re, together.

The SI crew.
